Now, Sweetwater is thrilled to present the full-sized, fully assembled MS-20. Available in four limited-edition colors, the MS-20 FS gives you all the synthy goodness of the FS, plus a number of enhancements serious synthesists have been clamoring for — including a highly playable, full-sized 37-note keyboard and two filter types from early- and late-model MS-20s. The MS-20 FS is the real deal, faithful to the original in every way. Today, over 40 years after its introduction, musicians can once again rock the legendary analog mojo of the Korg MS-20.",
